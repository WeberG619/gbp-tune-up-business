### Post 1: Problem Awareness

```
üö® Local business owners: Are you making these Google Business Profile mistakes?

I audited 50 businesses in [Your City] last month. Here's what I found:

‚ùå 73% have less than 10 photos (Google wants 20+)
‚ùå 64% haven't posted in 30+ days
‚ùå 81% are missing Q&As
‚ùå 45% don't have complete hours/info

Meanwhile, your competitors with optimized profiles are getting:
‚úÖ 3-5x more views
‚úÖ 10-20 more calls per week
‚úÖ Higher placement in local search

Your Google profile is free marketing. Don't waste it.

### Post 2: Case Study

```
üìä CASE STUDY: How a local coffee shop went from 3 to 47 customer calls in 2 weeks

Before:
‚Ä¢ 4 photos on Google
‚Ä¢ Last post: 6 months ago
‚Ä¢ Profile score: 38/100
‚Ä¢ ~3 calls/day

After optimization:
‚Ä¢ 22 professional photos
‚Ä¢ Weekly posts
‚Ä¢ Complete profile
‚Ä¢ Score: 89/100
‚Ä¢ ~12 calls/day

Total investment: $179
ROI: Paid for itself in 2 days

This isn't rocket science. It's just doing what Google asks you to do.

If you own a local business in [City], I'm offering free audits this week.

üí° 3 Google Business Profile tips that take 5 minutes but bring results for months:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Add "Attributes"
Go to your profile ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí More ‚Üí Attributes
Mark all that apply (Wi-Fi, parking, outdoor seating, etc.)
Google uses these for search filters!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload a "Logo" photo
Not just any photo - upload your actual logo as the profile image
Makes you look 10x more professional

3Ô∏è‚É£ Answer common questions
Add 5-10 Q&As that customers actually ask
Google shows these prominently in search

These tiny changes can boost your visibility significantly.

### Post 4: Behind the Scenes

```
My morning routine as a Google Business Profile optimizer:

8:00 AM - Audit 5 local businesses
9:30 AM - Walk into 3 of them with printed reports
11:00 AM - Close 1-2 clients
12:00 PM - Take 20 professional photos
1:30 PM - Optimize their profiles
3:00 PM - Client sees results same day

Yesterday a client called me at 4pm:
"I already got 3 customer calls since you fixed my profile!"

This is the most instant-ROI service I've ever offered.

If you're a local business owner still ignoring your Google profile, you're leaving money on the table.
