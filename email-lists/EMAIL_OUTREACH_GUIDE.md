## üìß Email Templates

### Template 1: Initial Outreach (Professional)

**Subject:** Quick question about [BUSINESS NAME]'s Google profile

---

Hi [NAME],

I was researching local [INDUSTRY] businesses in [CITY] this morning and came across [BUSINESS NAME].

I pulled up your Google Business profile and noticed a few quick wins that could help you get more customers:

‚Ä¢ Only [X] photos (competitors average [Y])
‚Ä¢ No posts in the last [TIME]
‚Ä¢ Missing Q&As and [OTHER GAPS]

**The problem:** Google shows complete profiles first - even to people searching right next to you.

**The solution:** I specialize in Google Business Profile optimization. I can upgrade your entire profile in 90 minutes:

‚úì 20 professional photos
‚úì 4 weeks of scheduled posts
‚úì 10 pre-answered Q&As
‚úì Complete profile optimization

One-time cost: $179
Timeline: This week
Guarantee: More calls in 14 days or full refund

Want me to send you a free audit report showing exactly what's missing from your profile?

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
[PHONE]
[WEBSITE]

P.S. I've attached a before/after from a local [SIMILAR BUSINESS] I optimized last week - their profile views went up 127% in 10 days.

---

### Template 2: Follow-Up (If No Response)

**Subject:** Re: [BUSINESS NAME]'s Google profile

---

Hi [NAME],

Following up on my email from [DATE] about optimizing your Google Business profile.

Quick question: Are you actively trying to get more customers through Google search, or is most of your business from referrals?

Either way, a complete Google profile is like free 24/7 advertising. Your competitors are getting 10-20 extra leads per week just from having better profiles.

I can fix yours in 90 minutes for $179. Same-day service available.

Want to see a free audit report first?

### Template 3: Value-First Approach

**Subject:** [FREE AUDIT] I analyzed [BUSINESS NAME]'s Google profile

---

Hi [NAME],

I'm helping local [INDUSTRY] businesses improve their Google visibility, and I created a free audit for [BUSINESS NAME].

**Here's what I found:**

‚ùå Profile completeness: 42% (competitors average 78%)
‚ùå Photo count: [X] (recommended: 20+)
‚ùå Last post: [TIME AGO] (should be weekly)
‚ùå Ranking for "[KEYWORD]": Page 2 (competitors on page 1)

**The good news:** These are easy fixes that can dramatically increase your phone calls and foot traffic.

I can optimize everything in one 90-minute visit:
‚Ä¢ Take 20 professional photos
‚Ä¢ Set up 4 weeks of posts
‚Ä¢ Complete all missing info
‚Ä¢ Add industry-specific Q&As

Cost: $179 one-time
Results: Typically 40-60% more profile views within 2 weeks
Guarantee: Full refund if you don't see improvement

Want the full audit report? I'll email it over (no strings attached).

Cheers,
[YOUR NAME]
[PHONE] | [WEBSITE]

### Template 4: Construction-Specific

**Subject:** Your competitors are getting jobs you're not seeing

---

Hi [NAME],

I was looking at Google Business Profiles for construction companies in [CITY], and I noticed [BUSINESS NAME] is missing out on leads.

**Here's why:**

When someone searches "general contractor near me" or "home remodeling [CITY]", Google ranks profiles with:
‚Ä¢ 20+ photos (you have [X])
‚Ä¢ Weekly posts (you last posted [TIME])
‚Ä¢ Complete business info (hours, services, etc.)

Right now, [COMPETITOR] is showing up first - even for people right next to your office.

**What you're losing:** 5-10 qualified leads per week. At your project size, that's potentially $50-100K in missed revenue per year.

**The fix:** One 90-minute session where I:
‚Ä¢ Photograph your team, projects, and equipment
‚Ä¢ Set up 4 weeks of posts
‚Ä¢ Optimize your profile for local search
‚Ä¢ Add service-specific Q&As

Investment: $179 (less than 1 hour of billable time for you)
Timeline: Same-day service available
ROI: Most contractors land 1-2 extra projects per month

Even ONE additional project pays for this 10x over.

### Template 5: Dental-Specific

**Subject:** How [COMPETITOR] is getting more new patients than you

---

Hi Dr. [NAME],

I analyzed Google Business Profiles for dental practices in [CITY], and I found something concerning for [PRACTICE NAME].

**The problem:**

When potential patients search "dentist near me" or "family dentist [CITY]", [COMPETITOR] appears first - even though you're closer and have better reviews.

Why? Their profile is 87% complete. Yours is 43%.

**What this means:**
‚Ä¢ [COMPETITOR] gets 15-20 new patient inquiries per week from Google
‚Ä¢ You're getting 4-6
‚Ä¢ The gap? A complete, optimized profile

**What I do:**

I specialize in Google Business Profile optimization for dental practices. One 90-minute visit:

‚úì 20 professional photos (office, team, technology)
‚úì Patient-focused posts (4 weeks scheduled)
‚úì FAQ setup ("Do you take my insurance?", "Emergency appointments?", etc.)
‚úì Complete profile optimization

**Results:**
‚Ä¢ 40-60% increase in profile views
‚Ä¢ 2-3x more phone calls
‚Ä¢ Higher ranking in local search

**Investment:** $179 one-time
**Timeline:** This week
**Guarantee:** More new patient inquiries in 14 days or full refund

Want a free competitive analysis showing where you're losing patients to competitors?

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]

   - Link to your website

3. **Make it easy to say yes**
   - Offer free audit (no commitment)
   - Same-day service
   - Money-back guarantee

4. **Follow up consistently**
   - Email 1: Day 1
   - Email 2: Day 3

## üö´ Emails to Avoid

These were found but are placeholder/invalid:

- filler@godaddy.com
- webreporting@gargle.com
- hi@typemade.mx
- eben@eyebytes.com
- jonpinhorn.typedesign@gmail.com
- hello@rfuenzalida.com (appears twice - template designer)

- Artboard-1-copy@4x-2048x520.png
- AnchoredBakery_0320_logocolor@4x.png
- mediainquiries@sebrands.com

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Send from a professional email** (@yourbusiness.com, not @gmail.com)

3. **Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-11am** (highest open rates)
4. **Keep it under 150 words** (busy business owners)
5. **One clear CTA** ("Want the free audit?")

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools to Use

- **Mail merge:** GMass, Mailchimp, or manual with BCC
- **Tracking:** Mailtrack (free Chrome extension)
