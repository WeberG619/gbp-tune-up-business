## ðŸš¨ COMMON QUESTIONS

### "Do I really need a website?"
**YES.** When prospects Google your business name (and they will), you need to look professional. A website costs $0 and takes 30 minutes.

### "Can I use a free Gmail address?"
You CAN, but it looks unprofessional. `contact@localrisemarketing.com` looks way better than `weber123@gmail.com`.

### "What if I don't have portfolio examples?"
Use the sample reports you generate from real businesses. Show before/after comparisons. First 1-2 clients, offer a discount in exchange for a testimonial.

### "Do I need business insurance/LLC?"
For first clients: No, just start. As you grow (5+ clients), consider forming an LLC. Insurance is optional but recommended.
