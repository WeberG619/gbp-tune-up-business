## üìû WHAT TO SAY

### Initial Contact (at their door):

**"Hi! Is [OWNER NAME] available? I have something quick to show them about their Google listing."**

### When owner appears:

**"Hi [NAME], I'm [YOUR NAME]. I pulled up your Google Business Profile this morning and noticed you have [X] photos while your competitors average [Y]. Can I show you something really quick that's probably costing you customers?"**

*(Show them their profile on your tablet)*

**"Google shows businesses with better profiles to MORE people. Right now, [COMPETITOR] is showing up before you even though you're closer/better.**

**I help local businesses fix this. Takes me 90 minutes:**
- **20 professional photos**
- **4 weeks of posts**
- **Complete profile optimization**

**$179, I can do it today. If you don't see more calls within 2 weeks, full refund. Should I grab my camera and get started?"**

### Handling "I need to think about it":

**"Totally understand. What specifically - the price or whether it'll work?"**

*Listen, then:*

**Price objection:** "You're probably losing 2-3 customers a week to better profiles. ONE extra customer pays for this. And I can start right now so you see results this week."

**Effectiveness objection:** "Fair question. Can I show you a before/after?" *(Show example report)*

## üö´ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Don't:
- ‚ùå Wait for "perfect" setup - start TODAY
- ‚ùå Worry about API key yet - demo mode works great
- ‚ùå Overthink the pitch - just do it
- ‚ùå Visit only 1-2 businesses - volume matters
- ‚ùå Give up after first "no" - it's normal
- ‚ùå Underprice ($50-100 is too cheap)
- ‚ùå Take days to deliver - same day or next day only

### Do:
- ‚úÖ Start with demo mode, add API later
- ‚úÖ Visit 8-10 businesses per day
- ‚úÖ Focus on easy wins (coffee, salons, gyms)
- ‚úÖ Practice pitch 5+ times before going out
- ‚úÖ Deliver FAST (same day = wow factor)
- ‚úÖ Ask for reviews and referrals
- ‚úÖ Track everything in spreadsheet

---

## üÜò IF YOU GET STUCK

### "Nobody is saying yes"
**Fix:**
- Lower price to $149 for first 3 clients
- Improve your pitch (practice more)
- Show better examples (generate real audits)
- Target easier prospects (businesses with 1-10 reviews)

### "I'm nervous to walk in"
**Fix:**
- Remember: You're HELPING them (they need this)
- Start with smaller, quieter businesses
- Practice on businesses you know won't buy (friend's place)
- Gets easier after first 3

### "Taking too long to deliver"
**Fix:**
- Use templates more (stop customizing everything)
- Batch similar tasks
- Skip perfection - good enough is fine
- Follow the 90-minute checklist exactly

### "Don't have Google API"
**Fix:**
- You don't need it yet!
- Use demo mode for examples
- Do manual audits for real clients (5 minutes to count photos/reviews)
- Set up API after first 5 clients
