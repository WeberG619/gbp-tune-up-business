## üí° Best Outreach Methods by Business Type

### Coffee Shops & Restaurants
**Best:** Walk-in during slow hours (2-4 PM)
- Managers are usually available
- Can show examples on your phone
- Immediate visual impact

### Salons & Spas
**Best:** Phone call (mornings 9-11 AM)
- Often too busy for walk-ins
- Decision maker (owner) may not be on-site
- Can schedule proper meeting

### Gyms & Fitness
**Best:** Walk-in (early morning or evening)
- Owners often work out at their own gym
- Athletic community appreciates direct approach
- Can take photos during visit

## üìû Quick Contact Scripts

### Walk-In Script (30 seconds)
```
"Hi! I was doing research on local businesses and noticed [BUSINESS NAME]
only has [X] photos on Google while competitors average 20+.

This is probably costing you customers - most people won't choose a business
with fewer photos.

I help fix this in 90 minutes for $179. Can I show you a quick comparison
of your profile vs. competitors?"
```

### Phone Script (1 minute)
```
"Hi, is the owner/manager available?

My name is [YOUR NAME], and I help local businesses improve their Google
visibility. I noticed [BUSINESS NAME] only has [X] photos on Google.

I can send you a free audit showing exactly how you compare to competitors
and what it's costing you in lost customers.

What's your email? I'll send it over in 2 minutes."
```

### Email Subject Lines (High Open Rates)
```
Subject: Your Google profile vs. [COMPETITOR NAME]
Subject: Losing customers to [COMPETITOR]? (Quick fix)
Subject: [BUSINESS NAME] - 3 minutes to more customers
```

## üìä Track Your Progress

Create a simple tracking sheet (or use the CSV):

| Date | Business | Method | Response | Status | Follow-up |
|------|----------|--------|----------|--------|-----------|

| 10/31 | Glamour Spa | Phone | No answer | - | Call 11/2 |
| 10/31 | CrossFit Box | Walk-in | Closed! | Paid $179 | Deliver 11/3 |

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Should I contact all 180 businesses?**
A: Start with top 50. You'll likely close enough clients before reaching #180.

**Q: What if they already have 20+ photos?**
A: The tool filters for poor profiles. But if you find one, check reviews, posts, Q&As instead.

**Q: Can I offer payment plans?**
A: Yes! "$89 upfront, $90 after results" reduces barrier.

**Q: How do I generate audit reports?**
A: Use `python tools/bulk_audit.py maps/market_leads_[timestamp].csv`

**Q: Should I do this full-time?**
A: Start part-time (evenings/weekends). 180 businesses = 4-6 weeks. Then decide.
