**Add 15 min to delivery time**

---

### Issue: Profile is unverified

**Charge 50% now, 50% after verification**

### Issue: Client wants unlimited changes

**Fix:**
Set expectations upfront:

"This package includes 1 round of revisions. If you want to change photos or rewrite posts, that's $29 per additional round. Sound good?"

---

### Issue: Client's photos are bad (cluttered, dark, etc.)

**Fix:**
1. Ask them to tidy up space before you shoot
2. Turn on all lights
3. If still bad, offer to reschedule: "Let's shoot this next week when the space is cleaner. I want you to get the best photos possible."

**Don't deliver bad work** - it reflects on you.

## üìà EFFICIENCY TIPS

**Ways to save time:**

1. **Batch editing:** Edit all photos at once, not one-by-one
2. **Use presets:** Save Lightroom editing preset, apply to all
3. **Template posts:** Don't write from scratch - customize templates
4. **Voice typing:** Dictate Q&A answers instead of typing
