## 🔥 ADVANCED TACTICS (After First 10 Clients)

### Tactic #1: Yelp/Google Reviews as Lead Source

**Process:**
1. Search "[industry] [city]" on Google
2. Sort by "recently reviewed"
3. Contact businesses with new 1-2 star reviews

**Pitch angle:**
"I saw you got a negative review. I help businesses improve their Google presence and get more positive reviews to offset the bad ones. Can I show you how?"

**Why it works:** They're already thinking about their online reputation.

---

### Tactic #2: Event Networking

**Find events:**
- Chamber of Commerce mixers
- Small business expos
- Industry meetups

**Bring:**
- Business cards
- Tablet loaded with examples
- Offer: "Free audit - let me pull up your profile right now"

**Close rate:** 40-50% (warm leads)

---

### Tactic #3: Partner with Web Designers

**Pitch to web designers:**
"I do Google Business Profile optimization. You do websites. Want to refer clients to each other? I'll give you 20% commission on any client you send."

**Why it works:** Web designers have small business clients who need this.

---

### Tactic #4: Run a "Google Visibility Challenge"

**Promote on social media:**

---

**FREE 7-Day Google Visibility Challenge**

I'm taking 5 local businesses through a free 7-day challenge to boost their Google rankings.

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Best time to pitch:** Tue-Thu, 10am-4pm (avoid Mon/Fri, early mornings, late evenings)

2. **Bring social proof:** Even 1 testimonial increases close rate 40%

3. **Ask for referrals IMMEDIATELY:** "Know 2 other business owners?" (right after they say yes)

4. **Use urgency:** "I have a slot open today at 3pm" (even if you're free all week)

5. **Follow up fast:** Respond to "maybes" within 24 hours or they go cold

6. **Batch your work:** Deliver 3-4 clients in one afternoon (more efficient)

7. **Collect payment upfront:** 50% minimum, ideally 100%. Reduces no-shows.

8. **Over-deliver initially:** First 5 clients, give them extra value (builds reviews/referrals)

9. **Track your close rate:** If it drops below 30%, revisit your pitch

10. **Don't compete on price:** If they push back, emphasize VALUE not cost

---

## 🚨 WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE NOT CLOSING

### Problem: No one is saying yes

**Possible causes:**
- ❌ Pitching wrong industries
- ❌ Pitching at wrong time of day
- ❌ Not showing visual proof
- ❌ Focusing on features, not results
- ❌ Weak confidence/tonality

**Fixes:**
1. Record yourself pitching (find the weak spots)
2. Bring before/after examples (visual proof converts)
3. Lower price temporarily to build portfolio ($99 for first 3)
4. Target easier industries (coffee shops, salons)
5. Practice pitch 20 times before going out

---

### Problem: Getting "maybes" but no closes

**Possible causes:**
- ❌ Not asking for the sale
- ❌ No urgency
- ❌ Price objection

**Fixes:**
1. Always end with: "Should I grab my camera and get started?"
2. Use time pressure: "I'm booked up next week, but I have time today"
3. Offer payment plan: "$99 today, $80 next week"

---

### Problem: People say "I'll do it myself"

**Fix:**
"Totally get it - Google makes the tools free. Most business owners I talk to have been meaning to do this for 6 months but haven't had time. I can knock it out this afternoon while you focus on running your business. Sound good?"

---

## 📈 SCALING PAST 10 CLIENTS

Once you hit 10 clients and have testimonials:

1. **Raise your prices** to $199 (test it - if close rate stays above 40%, keep it)

2. **Stop walking in cold** - Use referrals, Facebook groups, and Google ads

3. **Hire a VA** to handle photo editing and posting ($5-10/hr on Upwork)

4. **Build a simple website** with testimonials and booking calendar

5. **Focus on recurring revenue** - Convert 50% of clients to $59/mo maintenance

---

**Remember:** The first 3 customers are the hardest. After that, you have proof, confidence, and momentum. You've got this.
