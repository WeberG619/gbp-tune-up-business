I was researching local {industry} businesses in {location} and came across {business_name}.

I pulled up your Google Business Profile and noticed a few things that are probably costing you customers:

{reasons}

The problem: Google shows complete profiles FIRST - even to people searching right next to you. Incomplete = invisible.

I help North Idaho businesses fix this in 90 minutes:
‚Ä¢ 20 professional photos (exterior, interior, products, team)
‚Ä¢ Complete profile optimization (all info fields)
‚Ä¢ 4 weeks of scheduled posts
‚Ä¢ 10 pre-answered Q&As
‚Ä¢ Review reply templates

One-time cost: $179
Guarantee: More calls within 14 days or full refund

I've attached a free audit report showing exactly what's missing from your profile and how you compare to competitors.

Want to see it? Just reply "yes" and I'll send it over.

Best regards,
