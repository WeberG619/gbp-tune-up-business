I was researching local {industry} businesses in {city} this morning and came across {business_name}.

I noticed a few things about your Google Business Profile that might be costing you customers:

‚Ä¢ You have {photo_count} photos while competitors average 20+
‚Ä¢ {specific_issue}
‚Ä¢ Your profile needs optimization

I put together a quick audit report for you (attached PDF). Takes 2 minutes to read.

The short version: Google shows businesses with better profiles to MORE people. Right now, potential customers might be seeing competitors before you‚Äîeven though you might be closer or better.

I help local businesses fix this. Takes about 90 minutes:
‚úì 20 professional photos
‚úì 4 weeks of scheduled posts
‚úì Complete profile optimization

$179 one-time. Most clients see more calls within 2 weeks.

Want to chat for 5 minutes? I'm available this week.

Best,
{your_name}
{your_phone}
{your_email}

P.S. Even if you're not interested, the audit report is yours to keep. It shows exactly where you stand vs. competitors.

Following up on the Google Business Profile audit I sent over a few days ago.

Quick question: Did you get a chance to look at it?

I know you're busy running {business_name}, so here's the TL;DR:

Your profile is missing {missing_items}. This is probably costing you 5-10 customer calls per week.

I can fix everything in one 90-minute session for $179.

Two questions:
1. Are you seeing enough customer calls/foot traffic right now?
2. If not, would you be open to a quick 5-minute call?

I'm booking sessions for this week. Happy to squeeze you in.

Best,
