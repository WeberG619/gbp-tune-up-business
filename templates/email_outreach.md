## üìß EMAIL #1: Initial Outreach with Audit Report

**Subject Line Options** (Pick one):
1. `Quick question about [BUSINESS NAME]'s Google profile`
2. `[BUSINESS NAME] vs. competitors - 2-minute read`
3. `I found some issues with your Google Business listing`
4. `Free audit: [BUSINESS NAME] Google profile analysis`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [OWNER NAME],

I was researching local [INDUSTRY] businesses in [CITY] this morning and came across [BUSINESS NAME].

I noticed a few things about your Google Business Profile that might be costing you customers:

‚Ä¢ You have [X] photos while competitors average [Y]
‚Ä¢ [SPECIFIC ISSUE - no posts, missing hours, etc.]
‚Ä¢ Your profile scores [SCORE]/100 vs. competitor average of 78/100

I put together a quick audit report for you (attached PDF). Takes 2 minutes to read.

The short version: Google shows businesses with better profiles to MORE people. Right now, potential customers are seeing [COMPETITOR NAME] before you‚Äîeven though you might be closer or better.

I help local businesses fix this. Takes about 90 minutes:
‚úì 20 professional photos
‚úì 4 weeks of scheduled posts
‚úì Complete profile optimization

$179 one-time. Most clients see more calls within 2 weeks.

Want to chat for 5 minutes? I'm available [DAY] afternoon or [DAY] morning.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PHONE]
[YOUR EMAIL]

P.S. Even if you're not interested, the audit report is yours to keep. It shows exactly where you stand vs. competitors.
```

## üìß EMAIL #2: Follow-Up (3 days later)

**Subject:** `Re: [BUSINESS NAME] Google profile`

**OR:** `Did you get a chance to review the audit?`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [OWNER NAME],

Following up on the Google Business Profile audit I sent over on [DAY].

Quick question: Did you get a chance to look at it?

I know you're busy running [BUSINESS NAME], so here's the TL;DR:

Your profile is missing [X] photos and [Y] other elements. This is probably costing you 5-10 customer calls per week.

I can fix everything in one 90-minute session for $179.

Two questions:
1. Are you seeing enough customer calls/foot traffic right now?
2. If not, would you be open to a quick 5-minute call?

I'm booking sessions for [THIS WEEK/NEXT WEEK]. Happy to squeeze you in.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PHONE]

P.S. No pressure. Just wanted to make sure you saw the report. If it's not a priority right now, totally understand.
```

## üìß EMAIL #3: Final Follow-Up (7 days later)

**Subject:** `Last follow-up about [BUSINESS NAME]`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [OWNER NAME],

This is my last email‚ÄîI promise!

I sent over a free Google Business Profile audit for [BUSINESS NAME] last week, but haven't heard back.

Before I close your file, I wanted to check one more time:

**Are you happy with the number of customer calls/visits you're getting?**

If yes‚Äîawesome! Ignore this email.

If no‚ÄîI can help. $179, done in 90 minutes, 2-week money-back guarantee.

Here's my calendar link: [CALENDLY LINK OR PHONE]
OR just reply "interested" and I'll call you.

Either way, hope business is going well!

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PHONE]

P.S. The audit report I sent shows you're missing [X] photos compared to competitors. That alone could be the difference.
```

## üìß EMAIL #4: Alternative - "Case Study" Approach

**Subject:** `How [SIMILAR BUSINESS] got 15 more calls/week`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [OWNER NAME],

Quick story that might interest you:

Last month I worked with [SIMILAR BUSINESS TYPE] in [NEARBY CITY]. They had:
- Only 4 photos on their Google profile
- No posts in 6 months
- Profile score of 38/100

We spent 90 minutes optimizing their profile. Results after 2 weeks:
‚úì 3x more profile views
‚úì 15+ additional calls per week
‚úì 8 new customers (they tracked it)

I pulled up [BUSINESS NAME]'s profile and noticed similar issues:
‚Ä¢ [X] photos (competitors have [Y])
‚Ä¢ [SPECIFIC ISSUE]
‚Ä¢ Score: [SCORE]/100

Attached is your free audit report showing exactly where you stand.

Same service, same $179 investment, same 2-week guarantee.

Want to give it a shot? I have availability [DAY] and [DAY] this week.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PHONE]

## ü§ñ AUTOMATED EMAIL SEQUENCE (Recommended)

Use this 3-email sequence spaced out over 10 days:

| Day | Email | Subject | Conversion Rate |
|-----|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Day 0 | #1 - Initial | `Quick question about [BUSINESS]` | 10-15% |
| Day 3 | #2 - Follow-up | `Did you see the audit?` | 5-8% |
| Day 10 | #3 - Final | `Last follow-up` | 2-5% |

**Total Expected Response Rate:** 17-28% (with good targeting)

**Total Expected Close Rate:** 5-10% (1-2 clients per 20 emails)

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è PERSONALIZATION TIPS

**ALWAYS personalize these fields:**
1. `[OWNER NAME]` - Find on website or call business
2. `[BUSINESS NAME]` - Exact name from Google
3. `[CITY]` - Their city
4. `[INDUSTRY]` - coffee shop, salon, gym, etc.
5. `[SPECIFIC ISSUE]` - From their actual audit report

**Quick personalization research (2 minutes per lead):**
1. Visit their Google Business Profile
2. Visit their website (if they have one)
3. Read their reviews (mention a 5-star review if possible)
4. Note 1-2 specific issues to call out

**Example personalization:**
```
Generic: "I noticed your profile has some issues."

Personalized: "I noticed you only have 3 photos and no posts since June.
I also saw your 5-star review from Sarah who loved your caramel latte‚Äî
that's the kind of thing that should be featured in your profile!"
```

**This takes 60 seconds but increases response rate by 3-5x.**

---

## üìé ATTACHMENT TIPS

**What to attach:**
- The PDF audit report for THEIR specific business
- Keep it under 2MB (PDFs are usually 50-200KB)
- Name it clearly: `GoogleAudit_[BusinessName].pdf`

**What NOT to attach:**
- Generic/template reports
- Your portfolio (save for follow-up)
- Contracts (too soon)

---

## üìß FINDING EMAIL ADDRESSES

**Methods (in order of effectiveness):**

1. **Website contact form** - Use it, they'll reply with email
2. **Website "Contact Us" page** - Usually lists owner email
3. **Google Business Profile** - Sometimes shows email
4. **Call and ask** - "What's the best email to send this to?"
5. **Hunter.io or similar tools** - Find business emails
6. **LinkedIn** - Search owner, send message
7. **Format guess** - owner@businessname.com, info@, hello@

**Pro tip:** If you can't find email, use contact form or just call instead.

---

## üì± ALTERNATIVE: Text Message Outreach

If you get phone number but no email:

**Text Template:**

```
Hi [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME]. I run a local marketing service in [CITY].

I pulled up [BUSINESS NAME]'s Google profile and noticed you're missing some things that could bring in more customers (photos, posts, etc.).

Put together a free audit for you. Can I email it over?

What's the best email?
```

**Response rate:** 40-60% (much higher than email!)

**But:** More personal/intrusive, use sparingly.

---

## üìä TRACKING OUTREACH

Create a simple tracker (or use your client_tracking_template.csv):

| Business | Email Sent | Date | Response? | Follow-up 1 | Follow-up 2 | Status | Notes |

| Joe's Coffee | ‚úì | 1/15 | No | 1/18 | 1/25 | No response | Try call |

## üí∞ EXPECTED RESULTS

**Realistic email outreach metrics:**

| Metric | Rate |
|--------|------|
