## üéØ Response Handling

### If They Reply "YES" / "INTERESTED":

```
Great! I'll send over your free audit report showing:
- Your current Google profile score
- What competitors are doing better
- Exactly what's missing
- Estimated impact on calls/traffic

What's the best email to send it to? (I'll have it to you within 24 hours)

Also - are you free for a quick 10-min call this week? I can walk you through the report and answer any questions.

Best times for me: [YOUR AVAILABILITY]

Thanks!
Weber
(208) 555-1234
```

Then:
1. Generate their audit report: `python tools/gbp_audit.py "Business Name" "City, State" --pdf`
2. Email the PDF
3. Schedule call
4. Close the deal!

---

### If They Reply "NOT INTERESTED":

```
No problem! If anything changes, feel free to reach out.

One quick question (helps me improve): What made you say no? Too expensive? Not a priority? Already handled?

Either way, best of luck with the business!

Weber
```

**Why ask?** You'll learn objections and improve your pitch.

### If No Response After 3 Days:

**Follow-up email:**

```
Subject: Following up - Free audit for {Business Name}

Hi,

Just wanted to follow up on my email from a few days ago.

I know you're busy running the business, so I'll keep this short:

I'm offering free Google Business Profile audits to {industry} businesses this week. Takes me 10 minutes to create, shows you exactly what's costing you customers.

Want me to send it? Just reply "yes."

If not interested, reply "no thanks" and I won't bug you again!

Best,
Weber
(208) 555-1234
```

**Send this once.** If still no response, move on.

They'll call after reading your email. Be ready:

**Your Script:**

"Hi, this is Weber! Thanks for calling. Are you calling about the Google Business Profile audit I emailed?

[They say yes]

Great! So I took a quick look at [BUSINESS NAME]'s profile and found a few things we can improve. Do you have 5 minutes for me to walk you through it?

[Walk through their gaps]

Here's what I do: I come to your location, take 20 professional photos, optimize your entire profile, set up 4 weeks of posts, and handle all the technical stuff. Takes 90 minutes and you'll see results within days.

One-time cost is $179, and I guarantee more calls within 14 days or I refund you.
