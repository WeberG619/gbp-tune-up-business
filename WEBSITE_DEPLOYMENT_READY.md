## DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Update Your Contact Information

**IMPORTANT:** Replace these placeholders in `index.html`:

**Find and Replace:**
1. `YOUR PHONE NUMBER` â†’ Your actual phone number (appears 2 times)
   - Lines 500, 590
2. `YOUR EMAIL` â†’ Your actual email (appears 2 times)
   - Lines 513, 591
3. `tel:YOUR_PHONE` â†’ `tel:+12085551234` (your phone with country code)
   - Line 500
4. `mailto:YOUR_EMAIL` â†’ `mailto:yourname@example.com`
   - Line 513

**How to Update on Windows:**
1. Open `D:\gbp-tune-up-business\website\index.html` in Notepad
2. Press `Ctrl+H` to open Find and Replace
3. Find: `YOUR PHONE NUMBER`
4. Replace with: Your actual phone number
5. Click "Replace All"
6. Repeat for `YOUR EMAIL`
7. Save the file (`Ctrl+S`)

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

**Method 1: Drag and Drop (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Navigate to `D:\gbp-tune-up-business\website\` in Windows Explorer
3. Select ALL 4 files (index.html, style.css, script.js, README.md)
4. Drag them to the Netlify drop zone
5. Your site will be live in ~30 seconds!

**Method 2: Update Existing Site**
Since you already have `mellifluous-torrone-836797.netlify.app`:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click on your site `mellifluous-torrone-836797`
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Drag the updated `website` folder to deploy new version
5. Wait 30 seconds for build to complete

### Step 3: Change Site Name (Optional but Recommended)

Make your URL more professional:
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings"
2. Click "Change site name"
3. Enter: `localsearchpro` or `yourname-gbp-services`
4. Your new URL: `localsearchpro.netlify.app`

### Step 4: Configure Contact Form (Optional)

The form currently shows an alert. To make it actually send emails:

**Option A: Use Formspree (Free, Easiest)**
1. Go to https://formspree.io
2. Create free account
3. Create new form, get endpoint URL
4. In `script.js` line 137, replace `YOUR_FORM_ENDPOINT` with Formspree URL
5. Uncomment lines 136-155 (remove `/*` and `*/`)
6. Comment out lines 127-133 (add `/*` before 127, `*/` after 133)

**Option B: Use Netlify Forms (Free with Netlify)**
1. In `index.html` line 521, add attribute: `netlify`
2. That's it! Netlify handles the rest
3. View submissions in Netlify dashboard under "Forms"
