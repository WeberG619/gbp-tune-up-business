pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 2: Build Your Hit List (30 minutes)

Find 10 local businesses with bad Google profiles:

1. Open Google Maps
2. Search: "coffee shop [your city]"
3. Filter: 3-15 reviews (small but established)
4. Click each business â†’ Note:
   - Few photos (< 10)
   - No recent posts
   - Missing info (hours, phone, website)

**Create spreadsheet:**

| Business | Address | Phone | Score (guess) |
|----------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Joe's Coffee | 123 Main St | 555-1234 | Low (3 photos) |

---

## Step 3: Walk In (2 hours)

### The Script

**Walk in confidently:**
"Hi! Is the owner/manager available? I have something quick to show them about their Google listing."

**When they arrive:**
"Hi [NAME], I'm [YOUR NAME]. I pulled up your Google profile and noticed you have [X] photos while competitors average [Y].

This is costing you customers - Google shows complete profiles FIRST, even to people right next to you.

I can fix this in 90 minutes today:
- 20 professional photos
- 4 weeks of scheduled posts
- Full profile optimization

$179, and if you don't see more calls within 2 weeks, I'll refund you.

Should I grab my camera and get started?"

**Target:** Visit 8 businesses, close 2.

## ðŸ†˜ If You Get Stuck

### "No one is saying yes"

**Try:**
- Show visual proof (pull up their profile vs competitor)
- Lower price to $129 for first 3 clients (build portfolio)
- Target easier industries (coffee shops, salons)
- Practice pitch 10 more times

### "I don't know how to take good photos"

**Watch:**
- YouTube: "How to take professional iPhone photos"
- Use portrait mode
- Turn on all lights
- Take 3 shots of each angle, pick best

### "I'm nervous to walk in"

**Remember:**
- You're HELPING them (they need this)
- Practice makes perfect (gets easier after #3)
- Worst case: they say no (move to next business)
