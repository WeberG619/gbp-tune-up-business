## 📧 Automated Email Outreach

1. System picks top 10 leads by score
2. Creates personalized email for each
3. Attaches their custom audit report
4. Sends with 30-second delay between emails
5. Tracks who was contacted
6. Schedules follow-up for 3 days later

### Email Features

## 💡 Automation Tips

### 1. **Start Small**
- Run automation with 10 leads first
- Test the emails (dry run)
- Get comfortable with the system
- Then scale up

### 2. **Batch Your Outreach**
- Don't send 100 emails in one day (spam filters)
- Send 10-20 per day maximum
- Space them out by 30-60 seconds

### 3. **Follow Up Religiously**
- 50% of sales happen after 5th contact
- Use the automated follow-up system
- Most people don't respond to first email

### 4. **Track Everything**
- Check dashboard weekly
- Monitor conversion rates
- Adjust email copy if response rate is low

### 5. **Focus on High Priority**
- Sort by score (highest first)
- These are easiest to close
- Build testimonials from early wins
