Word-for-word scripts to close your first 10 customers. Practice these until they're natural.

## üö∂ IN-PERSON WALK-IN PITCH (The "Tablet Close")

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**Success rate:** 60-70% with audit in hand

### Opening
*Walk in confidently with tablet showing THEIR Google profile*

**You:** "Hi! Is [OWNER/MANAGER NAME] available? I have something quick to show them about their Google listing."

*When they arrive:*

**You:** "Hi [NAME], I'm [YOUR NAME]. I was researching local [INDUSTRY] businesses this morning and pulled up your Google profile. Can I show you something really quick?"

*Turn tablet to show their profile*

### The Hook (Problem Identification)

**You:** "So I noticed you have [X] photos here, and your competitors average [Y]. I also see you're missing [SPECIFIC THINGS - hours, posts, Q&As, etc.].

Here's why this matters: Google shows businesses with better profiles to MORE people. So right now, potential customers are seeing [COMPETITOR NAME] before you - even though you might be closer or better."

*Let that sink in for 2 seconds*

### The Solution

**You:** "I help local businesses fix this. It takes me about 90 minutes, and here's what I do:

1. Take 20 professional photos of your business
2. Upload them with the right keywords
3. Add weekly posts for the next month
4. Fill in all the missing info
5. Set up 10 Q&As that customers actually search for

I'll do this TODAY - I can start right now if you're free."

### The Price

**You:** "The one-time setup is $179. And if you don't see more phone calls or foot traffic within 2 weeks, I'll refund you completely."

*Pause. Let them respond.*

### Objection: "I need to think about it"

**You:** "Totally understand. What specifically do you want to think about - the price or whether this will actually work?"

*Listen to their answer*

**If price:** "I get it. Here's the thing - you're probably losing 2-3 customers a week to competitors with better profiles. Even ONE extra customer pays for this. And I can start right now so you're getting results this week."

**If effectiveness:** "Fair question. Can I show you a before/after from another [INDUSTRY] business I did last week?"

*Show example on tablet*

"They went from 3 calls a day to 8-10. It's the same Google algorithm for everyone - better profile = more visibility."

### Objection: "That's expensive"

**You:** "I hear you. What does a new customer bring you in revenue, typically?"

*They'll say a number - let's say $150*

**You:** "Right. So if this brings you just TWO extra customers this month, you're already profitable. And most businesses see way more than that. Plus, the photos and setup last forever - you own them."

### Objection: "I'll do it myself"

**You:** "Absolutely, you could! Google makes the tools free. The challenge is most business owners I talk to have been meaning to do this for months but haven't had the time.

I can knock this out in 90 minutes TODAY while you focus on running your business. And honestly, I've done hundreds of these - I know exactly what Google ranks higher."

### The Close

**You:** "Look, here's what I suggest: Let me spend the next 90 minutes upgrading your profile. I'll show you everything before I publish it. If you don't love it, you don't pay. Fair?"

*Extend hand for handshake*

**You:** "Should I grab my camera and get started?"

## üìû COLD CALL SCRIPT

**Duration:** 3-4 minutes
**Success rate:** 15-25% to booked meeting

### Opening

**You:** "Hi, is [OWNER/MANAGER] available? This is [YOUR NAME] calling about your Google Business listing."

*If gatekeeper asks "What's this regarding?"*

**You:** "I found some gaps in [BUSINESS]'s Google profile that are probably costing them customers. Takes 2 minutes to explain - is [OWNER] available?"

*When decision-maker picks up:*

### The Hook

**You:** "Hi [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME]. I'm reaching out because I was looking at your Google Business profile and noticed a few things that might be costing you customers. Do you have 2 minutes?"

*Wait for yes*

**You:** "Great. I pulled up your profile and compared it to your top 3 competitors. Here's what I found:

- You have [X] photos, they average [Y]
- You haven't posted anything in [TIME]
- You're missing [SPECIFIC INFO]

The problem is Google's algorithm shows complete profiles FIRST - even to people searching right next to your location. So you're losing visibility."

### The Qualification

**You:** "Quick question - do you actively try to get more customers through Google, or is most of your business referrals?"

*Listen. If they say "mostly referrals":*

**You:** "That makes sense - word of mouth is powerful. But here's the thing: Google is basically free advertising that runs 24/7. Your competitors are getting 10-20 extra calls a week just from having a better profile. That's revenue you're leaving on the table."

### The Offer

**You:** "Here's what I do: I spend 90 minutes upgrading your entire Google presence. Professional photos, weekly posts, Q&As, the whole thing. One-time cost of $179.

I can come by this week, do it all in one visit, and you'll start seeing results within days. Can I send you a quick audit report first so you can see exactly what's missing?"

### Getting the Meeting

**Them:** "Yeah, send it over."

**You:** "Perfect. What's your email?

[GET EMAIL]

Sending it now. I'm also going to include 2 time slots this week when I can come by and knock this out. Which works better for you - [TUESDAY 2PM] or [THURSDAY 11AM]?"

*Book the meeting*

**You:** "Great, I've got you down for [DAY/TIME]. You'll have the audit in your inbox in 10 minutes. See you [DAY]!"

- 10 pre-answered Q&As
- Full profile optimization

## üéØ OBJECTION HANDLING CHEAT SHEET

### "I don't have time right now"

**Response:** "That's exactly why I'm here - you don't need to do anything. I'll take the photos, write the posts, set everything up. You just review it before I publish. Takes you 5 minutes total."

---

### "My nephew/employee can do this"

**Response:** "Totally! If they have time, absolutely. But if it's been sitting on the to-do list for a while, I can knock it out TODAY and your [nephew/employee] can focus on other stuff. Also, I've done 50+ of these - I know exactly what ranks."

---

### "We get enough customers already"

**Response:** "That's awesome - congrats! Quick question: are you ever fully booked, or do you have capacity for more?"

*If they have capacity:*

**Response:** "Right, so this is basically free advertising filling your slow times. And even if you're busy now, having a strong Google presence protects you if things slow down seasonally."

---

### "Can you send me more info?"

**Response:** "Absolutely. What specifically would you like to know - pricing, timeline, or examples of results?"

*After they answer:*

**Response:** "Got it. Let me send you [THAT INFO], and I'll include 2 time slots this week when I can come by. If you like what you see in the email, we can knock it out. Sound good?"

---

### "I need to talk to my [partner/spouse/co-owner]"

**Response:** "Makes sense. Are they here now?"

*If yes:* "Great, let me show you both really quick - takes 2 minutes."

*If no:* "No problem. What if I send you the audit report so you can review it together, and I'll follow up tomorrow? When's a good time to call back?"

---

### "Google doesn't matter for my industry"

**Response:** "I hear that a lot! Can I ask - when you need [RELATED SERVICE], where do you look first?"

*They'll probably say Google*

**Response:** "Exactly. Google did a study - 76% of people who search for a local business on their phone visit within 24 hours. Your customers ARE searching. Question is whether they find you or [COMPETITOR]."

---

### "I already do social media marketing"

**Response:** "That's great - social is important. But here's the difference: on social media, you're hoping people see your post. On Google, people are ACTIVELY SEARCHING for what you sell RIGHT NOW. It's the warmest traffic you can get - and it's free."

---

### "I'll think about it and get back to you"

**Response:** "Totally fair. Real quick - what's making you hesitate? Price, timing, or whether this will actually work?"

*Address their specific concern, then:*

**Response:** "Tell you what - let me send you the free audit report so you have all the info. I'll follow up Friday. If it's a no, just say so - no pressure. Deal?"

---

## üî• THE "REVERSE PITCH" (For Confident Sellers)

Use this if the business owner seems skeptical or resistant.

**You:** "Can I be honest with you?"

*Wait for yes*

**You:** "I do about 10 of these a week. I don't need your business specifically - I'm just trying to help local businesses compete.

Your Google profile is weak compared to competitors, and that's costing you money. I can fix it in 90 minutes for less than most people spend on lunch for the week.

If you want to do it, great - I'm here now and can start. If not, totally cool - but 3 months from now when [COMPETITOR] is getting more calls, don't say nobody told you."

*Then stop talking. Let them decide.*

## üí∞ PRICING PRESENTATION

**Never lead with price.** Build value first, then price.

### The Value Stack

"Here's what you're getting for $179:

‚úÖ 20 professional photos ($300 value)
‚úÖ 4 weeks of scheduled posts ($200 value)
‚úÖ 10 Q&As with answers ($150 value)
‚úÖ Profile optimization ($100 value)
‚úÖ Competitor analysis report ($50 value)

**Total value: $800**
**Your price: $179**

Plus, this works 24/7. Even while you sleep, Google is showing your profile to potential customers. That's worth way more than $179."

### Anchoring High

"Most agencies charge $500-1000 for this. I keep it low because I can do it fast, and I'm building my portfolio. You're getting a deal, honestly."

### Payment Plans (If Needed)

"If $179 is tight right now, I can do $89 today and $90 next week. But I need something today to block out my time for you."

---

## üìà UPSELLS (After They Say Yes)

### Monthly Maintenance

**You:** "One more thing - I also offer a monthly service where I post weekly, reply to reviews, and keep everything fresh. It's $59/month. Want me to include that, or just the one-time setup for now?"

*If they say yes: +$59/month recurring!*

### Rush Fee

**You:** "I'm pretty booked this week, but I can bump you to the front of the line for an extra $30. Otherwise, earliest I can start is [3 DAYS FROM NOW]."
