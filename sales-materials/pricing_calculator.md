## üî• PRICING MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ‚ùå Pricing Too Low
"I'll do it for $50 to get clients!"

**Why it's bad:**
- You'll attract cheapskates
- Hard to raise prices later
- Can't scale (too much work for too little)
- Seems "too good to be true" = low quality

**Fix:** Start at $179. You can always discount, but can't easily increase.

---

### ‚ùå Giving Too Many Discounts
"I'll give you $50 off since you're my first client!"

**Why it's bad:**
- Trains clients to expect discounts
- Leaves money on the table
- Hard to enforce "list price" later

**Fix:** Offer discounts strategically (referrals, bundles), not automatically.

---

### ‚ùå Not Charging for Revisions
"Oh, you want different photos? Sure, I'll redo it for free."

**Why it's bad:**
- Scope creep kills your hourly rate
- Clients will ask for endless changes

**Fix:** Include 1 round of revisions, then charge $29 per additional round.

---

### ‚ùå Undervaluing Your Time
"$179 seems like a lot for 2 hours of work..."

**Why it's bad:**
- You're not just selling time, you're selling RESULTS
- Ignores your expertise and tools
- Race to the bottom

**Fix:** Remember, they're paying for MORE CUSTOMERS, not your time.

---

## ‚úÖ PRICING BEST PRACTICES

1. **Always collect 50%+ upfront** - Protects you from no-shows
2. **Raise prices every 10 clients** - $179 ‚Üí $199 ‚Üí $229
3. **Charge more in wealthy areas** - Adjust by zip code
4. **Focus on VALUE, not price** - "More customers" not "cheap service"
5. **Test pricing** - Try $199 on next 5 clients, see if close rate changes
6. **Bundle for higher average sale** - Setup + 3 months = $299

---

## üìû PRICING OBJECTION RESPONSES

### "That's too expensive"

**Response:** "I understand. What does a typical new customer bring you in revenue?"

*They say $150*

"So if this brings you just 2 extra customers this month, you've already doubled your investment. Most clients see 5-10+ new customers. It's not an expense, it's an investment that pays for itself."

---

### "Can you do it for $100?"

**Response:** "I wish I could, but $179 is already below market rate. Most agencies charge $500+. At $179, I'm basically giving you wholesale pricing. I can't go lower and still deliver the quality you deserve."

---

### "I need to check with my spouse/partner"

**Response:** "Totally understand. What price point would make this a no-brainer for you both?"

*Gauge their budget, see if you can meet in the middle*

---

Remember: **Your pricing reflects your value.** Don't compete on price - compete on results.
